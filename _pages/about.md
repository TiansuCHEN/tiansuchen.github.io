I am an eXtended Reality (XR) Research Assistant in [Health Care Engineering Systems Center](https://healtheng.illinois.edu/) at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), focusing on Human-Computer Interaction and AR/VR simulation in medical training and diagnosis, under the supervision of Prof. [Inki Kim](https://grainger.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/inkikim). I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from UIUC, where I worked with Prof. [Elah√© Soltanaghai](https://elahe.web.illinois.edu/). Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies at ShanghaiTech University, working under the guidance of Prof [Kewei Tu](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/).

My research interest lies in Human-Computer Interaction, Spatial Computing, AR/VR Simulation and Human-AI Collaboration.
