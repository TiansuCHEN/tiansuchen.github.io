I'm an eXtended Reality (XR) Research Assistant in [Health Care Engineering Systems Center](https://healtheng.illinois.edu/) at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from UIUC, where I worked with Prof. [Elah√© Soltanaghai](https://elahe.web.illinois.edu/). Before this, I was an undergraduate at ShanghaiTech University supervised by Prof. [Kewei Tu](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/).

My research interest lies in Human-Computer Interaction, Spatial Computing, AR/VR Simulation and Human-AI Collaboration.
